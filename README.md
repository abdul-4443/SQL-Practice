#  Database Design

This repo is made to showcase some practice problems I did during my Database Systems learning journey.

###  Content
* **SQL Challenges:** Complex joins, subqueries, and window functions.
* **Schema Design:** Normalization and ER Diagrams.
* **Optimization:** Indexing strategies and Query Execution Plans.

###  Environment
Solutions are provided for **PostgreSQL/MySQL**. Look for the `setup.sql` file in each problem folder to initialize the test data.
